# Sally
Sally is a simple wrapper around the Wally API in the form of a plugin to easily download packages right inside Roblox Studio.

It is NOT a substitute for a real "package manager-like" workflow. I built this because I prefer working inside Studio compared to using external editors and sync tools like Rojo.

## Getting Started
To install the plugin, run:

```bash
rojo build --plugin "Sally.rbxmx"
```
